# Graham-M
Hey, my name is Graham Morrison and Iâ€™m a 2nd year software engineer at Mcmaster University.

I just finished a SWE Internship @[Canoo]([url](https://www.canoo.com/)) and now am working hard at school. Outside of school I'm continuing to work on personal projects and am looking for Summer 2023 intership oppurtunties.

If you'd like to know more about my projects or just me in general, check out my [portfolio]([url](grahammorrison.ca) or send me a message on [LinkedIn]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/in/morrison-e-graham/))!
